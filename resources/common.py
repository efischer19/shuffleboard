This file is intended to be accessed everywhere in shuffleboard via
'from commom import *', so all variables should be of form __foo__ or FOO.

This is to allow for ease of use, without cluttering up namespaces. If a
variable is not needed in all files, it should not be declared in this file.
If a piece of code thinks it needs a new __foo__ or FOO variable, it should
probably be declared here instead.
